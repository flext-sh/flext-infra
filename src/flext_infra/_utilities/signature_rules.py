"""Declarative signature-migration catalogue for call-site propagation.

A signature change is not one edit: renaming a parameter means rewriting every
call site that passes it by keyword. Done by hand it is a sweep over the whole
fleet, repeated in every branch that has not merged yet. The transformer that
performs it already exists; what was missing is the declared catalogue it reads,
so the capability was unreachable.
