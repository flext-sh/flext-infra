"""Warning-free Rope project boundary.

Rope 1.14.0 and its current upstream branch decorate
``Project._init_source_folders`` as deprecated while still calling it
unconditionally from ``Project.__init__``.  A strict warnings-as-errors runtime
therefore cannot construct the documented public ``Project`` at all.  The
boundary below preserves Rope's initializer semantics without filtering the
warning or weakening the process warning policy.
