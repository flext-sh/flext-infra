"""GitPython repository helpers for the private git facet.

Only ``git_refresh_binary``, ``git_open_repo``, and ``git_repo`` live here.
Semantic operations use GitPython's object-oriented API (``Repo``, ``IndexFile``,
``Remote``, ``BaseIndexEntry``) or the ``repo.git.<cmd>(args)`` proxy directly;
``Git(path).execute(tuple)`` with manual cast/protocol is eliminated.
