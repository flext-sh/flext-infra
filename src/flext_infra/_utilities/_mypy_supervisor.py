"""Darwin Mypy supervisor: sampled process-group RSS and wall-clock deadline.

This executable module uses only the standard library, so supervising starts
before importing the checker or its dependencies. Darwin's initial VM mappings
can already exceed the configured memory budget; RLIMIT_AS cannot represent a
usable allocation ceiling there. RSS is sampled every 100 ms instead. It is a
termination threshold, not a kernel allocation barrier: transient overshoot is
possible. Linux retains its kernel-enforced address-space limit.
