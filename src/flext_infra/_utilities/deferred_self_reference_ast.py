"""AST analysis for deferred self-reference and recursive model defects.

Two structural defects share one root cause: a nested model that cannot name
what it depends on at class-body execution time.

1. DEFERRED_SELF_REFERENCE — ``default_factory=lambda: Outer.Sibling()``.
   A ``default_factory`` runs while the class body executes, and the outer
   class name is still unbound there, so the author wraps the reference in a
   lambda to postpone resolution. That converts a definition-order defect
   into a runtime one and hides it from every static gate.

2. RECURSIVE_MODEL — a model whose annotation or default reaches itself,
   directly or through the outer namespace. Instantiation then depends on a
   type that is not finished being defined.

The canonical repair for both is the workspace's diamond-MRO composition:
hoist the referenced model into its own namespace class, inherit that
namespace, and reference the model as a resolved base-class attribute. Every
default then stays a direct callable.
