"""Single owner of the workspace manifest path and the fleet-umbrella question.

Every consumer that needs to know where the workspace manifest lives, or
whether a checkout declares itself a fleet umbrella, asks here. The expression
existed in five places before this module, and the sixth copy asked the wrong
file: it tested the Beads override, which every project carries, so every
standalone project was classified as an umbrella. That misrouting silently
dropped each new project's README and project docs.

One owner exists so a seventh copy cannot be written.
