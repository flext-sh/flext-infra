        Conform settles ``pyproject.toml`` and every rendered projection first,
        so the lock resolves against them; it upgrades nothing (only ``upg``
        resolves the newest releases). The lock is ``root``'s own: a checkout
        uv resolves as a member of an enclosing uv workspace fails before any
        effect, because ``uv lock`` there rewrites the enclosing lock and never
        this one. ``refresh_git_peers`` refreshes the
        metadata of the dependencies declared through git only — moving
        sources by declaration — because a peer that moved on the
        integration branch carries stale cached requires-dist a retaining
        lock cannot see through; the propagate caller owns the flag and the
        default stays hermetic. Identical inputs regenerate identical bytes,
