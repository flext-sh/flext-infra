"""Fresh-process import quality gate.

Imports the checkout's published package and its declared entry points in
fresh child processes of the checkout's own runtime. The proof belongs to
``make check``: it needs the environment ``make setup`` provisions, so it is
never a precondition of the generation that publishes the package.
