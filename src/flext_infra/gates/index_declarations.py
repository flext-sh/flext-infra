"""Index-vs-declarations quality gate.

An undeclared gitlink makes a repository unfetchable, and nothing local says
so. Git records a directory carrying its own ``.git`` as a gitlink (mode
``160000``) the moment it is staged -- a linked worktree swept in by a broad
``git add`` is enough, with no warning. With no matching ``.gitmodules``
section Git cannot resolve a URL for it, so ``git submodule update --init``
exits 128 during checkout. Every consumer fetching the repository as a Git
dependency then fails before a line of its code is read, taking the whole
fleet down while the repository looks healthy to whoever committed it.

The vocabulary is the repository's own ``.gitmodules``; this gate declares no
path, name, or prefix.

Scope deliberately stops here. "Tracked while its own ignore rules match it"
was measured across the fleet and is a legitimate, widely used pattern:
projects ignore a directory broadly and then track specific files inside it
(committed projections, a pinned tracker identity). Treating that as a defect
produced 297 findings across five repositories, none of them real. An
undeclared gitlink has no legitimate form -- Git itself cannot resolve it --
which is why it is the invariant worth a gate.
