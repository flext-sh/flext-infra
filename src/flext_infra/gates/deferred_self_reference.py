"""Deferred self-reference quality gate.

Blocks two structural defects that share one root cause — a nested model that
cannot name what it depends on while its own class body executes:

* ``default_factory=lambda: Outer.Sibling()`` postpones a name resolution the
  definition order should have satisfied, turning a structural defect into a
  runtime one that no static gate can see.
* a field annotated with its own owner cannot be instantiated while that
  owner is still incomplete.

The canonical repair is diamond-FLEXT composition: hoist the referenced model
into its own namespace class, inherit that namespace, and reference the model
as a resolved base-class attribute.
