"""Session binding of an external consumer onto one flext worktree.

An external project declares flext packages by pinned git URL, so it always
validates PUBLISHED code. A cross-project change therefore could not be reviewed
until it was published, which inverts the order of work.

``FLEXT=<worktree>`` rebinds the consumer's environment onto that checkout for
the session. It is deliberately NOT a declaration: the consumer's
``pyproject.toml`` is never modified, so a local path can never be committed and
running setup without the flag restores the pinned resolution. Persistent,
declared sources remain owned by ``pyproject_conform._sync_uv_sources``; this
service owns only the session override, so the two never overlap.

The rebind set is derived from the intersection of what the consumer declares
and what the worktree actually provides, read from the worktree's own manifest —
never a hardcoded package list.
