"""Guard 5 — tier / abstraction-boundary enforcer.

Enforces AGENTS.md §2.7 abstraction-boundary rules: each external library
listed in ``c.ENFORCEMENT_LIBRARY_OWNERS`` (flext-core SSOT) has exactly
one owning FLEXT project. Bare runtime imports of those libs outside the
canonical wrapper sites are violations.

Uses rope's semantic import resolution so ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` imports
are automatically exempt (they live in conditional blocks that rope
skips when collecting runtime imports).

Mandate: 100% ROPE-based per the flext-infra detector mandate — no raw
``ast``/``libcst`` source analysis. Uses
``u.Infra`` Rope boundary helpers.
