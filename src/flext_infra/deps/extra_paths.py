"""Synchronize pyright, mypy, and pyrefly paths from workspace dependencies.

Handlers are called by the canonical CLI via FlextInfraCliDeps.register_deps.

Every emitted entry is relative to the project that owns the file it is written
into. A dependency that lives in another checkout resolves through its installed
distribution in the environment the project runs against, never through a
filesystem hop out of the project root: a generated surface that encodes
``../<sibling>/src`` describes one host layout, so it is wrong in any checkout
whose siblings sit elsewhere and it makes one generator emit different content
per clone (flext-c6di).
