"""Centralized constants for the release subpackage.

The release protocol derives every version bump from the Conventional Commits
subject that a merged pull request leaves on its merge commit, writes the
version only through the protocol, and identifies a release by one tag shape.
These are external contracts (Conventional Commits, PEP 440, Git), so they are
constants rather than configuration.
