"""Project-scaffold manifest (data) for ``flext-infra codegen new``.

Per ADR-005 this is the single source of truth describing *which* templates make
up a new project and *where* each lands. The engine (``u.Cli.template_render_dir``,
flext-cli) is policy-free; this manifest + the rope-derived context carry all the
FLEXT naming policy. Template-backed artifacts use ``.j2`` sources; typed
manifest artifacts serialize their Pydantic contract in the scaffold cycle.

Output paths use ``{token}`` placeholders (resolved by the service from rope) so
the engine never sees FLEXT naming. NOTE: the large-row form migrates to
``config/codegen/project_manifest.yaml`` in the ``conform`` slice (ADR-005 SSOT).
