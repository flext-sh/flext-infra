        ``metadata.context`` for a captured ``$VAR`` and the engine admits the
        finding only when the predicate holds (``is``) or fails (``not``). Each
        predicate is derived from an existing source of truth:

        - ``stdlib-module``: the captured module's top-level name is in the
          interpreter's ``sys.stdlib_module_names``;
        - ``own-package``: it is the project's own import package (the
          package of its ``pyproject.toml`` project);
        - ``runtime-package``: it is the import package of a distribution in
          the project's runtime dependency closure;
        - ``facade-package``: it is a runtime package that publishes runtime
          aliases through its generated lazy exports;
        - ``runtime-alias``: the captured name is a runtime alias published
          by the package named by the ``of`` capture (the own package when
          ``of`` is absent);
        - ``local-alias``: it is a runtime alias the own package binds in its
          own modules (their ``__all__``);
        - ``module-export``: it is declared in the ``__all__`` of the
          finding's own module;
        - ``package-export``: it is declared in the ``__all__`` of the module
          named by the ``of`` capture;
        - ``file-family``: it is a facade letter (tooling import-layer order)
          of the family the finding's module belongs to: the letters its own
          ``__all__`` declares and those its private family package's facade
          module declares;
        - ``facade-module``: the finding's module declares a facade letter in
          its ``__all__`` (the captured value is not read);
        - ``later-layer``: the captured import (a module of the own package or
          a facade letter) belongs to a later layer of the import-layer order
          than the finding's module;
        - ``import-cycle``: the captured import (module as written, with the
          imported name as ``of``) is an edge of a runtime import cycle of the
          project's import graph;
        - ``composes-family``: the captured class of a facade module reaches,
          through its bases, every class the facade's family package
          declares in ``__all__``;
        - ``class-stem``: the captured class name starts with the project's
          class stem as class nesting derives it (``Tests`` + stem under the
          tests tree; ``Examples``/``Scripts`` + stem or the bare stem under
          those surfaces);
        - ``package-layers``: the finding's package provides every layer the
          rule names in ``arg`` (a declared facade letter, a module, a
          private module or a subpackage of that name);
        - ``family-base``: the private family package holding the finding's
          module begins with ``base.py``.

        ``later-layer`` compares with the layer the rule names in ``arg`` when
        it names one.
