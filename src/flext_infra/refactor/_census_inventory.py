        Discovers governed projects via ``u.Infra.projects(workspace_root)``
        (canonical workspace project discovery — SSOT). For each project
        whose hyphenated name converts to a Python package, imports the
        package and walks dynamic facade aliases at depth 1

        Returns ``{symbol_name: (parent_path, ...)}`` so a consumer-defined
        symbol with the same name can be cross-referenced against every
        parent that declares it.

        inherited from ABCs (``clear``, ``get``, …) are skipped — every
        mapping class shares them, so they are not collision candidates.

        Filters out attributes whose values' ``__module__`` is not in the
        flext package tree.

        Read-only runtime introspection — NO Rope, NO source-tree walking,
        NO subprocess. Skips packages that fail to import (sub-repo
        environments may not have every flext-* installed).
