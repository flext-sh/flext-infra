# Plan collection

The documentation collector prepares authenticated file plans; the existing
documentation transaction alone publishes them. It neither executes an LLM nor
decides implementation status, supersession, deletion, or Bead closure.

The repository owns source associations in `config/plan-collection.yaml`.
`canonical_dir` is repository-relative; `projection_root` is a separately
authorized absolute output owner. Each source declares its provider, stable ID,
root, adapter, driver/version, plan globs, optional exclusions, timestamp fields,
companion-directory policy, and publication classification.

The `files` adapter accepts explicitly associated plan artifacts, snapshots each
plan and its same-basename companion directory, and includes attachments in the
revision digest. Stable identities separate incoming source revisions from the
canonical plan: existing reconciled text is never overwritten by collection.
The companion directory retains incoming revisions and provenance receipts.
Receipt locators are relative to the configured source and canonical owners;
moving a collected corpus between checkouts does not change its identities or
embed the former checkout or personal home path in versioned provenance.

`private-inventory` automatically inventories declared session sources for
agent reading. It never publishes session contents. Its coverage is explicitly
incomplete for extraction and reconciliation, not equivalent to collected plans.
An unavailable source fails; an empty source is reported distinctly.

The generated manifest records artifact ownership and exact content digests,
not workflow state. Unchanged projected outputs do not become fresh inputs.
An edited projected plan or companion retains its original identity and is
collected as a new incoming revision. Changes to projected ownership metadata
fail closed. Recursive source globs treat same-name companions as attachments,
not independent plans.

Explicit source timestamps retain their declared value separately from ISO 8601
UTC normalization, which is populated only for timezone-aware timestamps.
Date-only and local-datetime precision is preserved; absent timestamps remain
unknown. UTF-8 BOM and CRLF frontmatter are accepted without rewriting archived
source bytes.
Filesystem timestamps are not treated as substantive source updates.

The publisher authenticates inputs and source topology before effects. It must
register the projection as an explicit transaction participant and account for
declared read/write aliases; it must not relax path-escape validation.
The post-publication verifier checks every declared output against its planned
bytes and mode, while retaining exact snapshots for unrelated inputs. Manifest,
receipt and canonical text reads, including absence, are bound on first read so
a concurrent edit cannot be adopted as a newer precondition for stale output.
Collection reports are not evidence that semantic reconciliation is complete.
