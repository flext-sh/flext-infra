# Local config overrides (per-clone, gitignored)

The flext-infra codegen ships a **public** fleet configuration: everything in
`config/*.yaml` is tracked, published, and safe for an external adopter. Values
that are operator-private — consumer organizations, deploy-key contracts,
private workspace layouts — must never be committed here. They live in one
optional, gitignored file:

```
config/codegen-overrides.local.yaml
```

## Contract

- **Merge order**: tracked `config/*.yaml` files first (sorted), then the
  platform user overlay (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flext-infra/*.yaml`), then
  `codegen-overrides.local.yaml` **last** — the local file wins every scalar
  collision.
- **Merge semantics**: identical to the tracked pipeline — recursive dict
  merge, lists concatenate, scalars replace. Dict-typed registries
  (`ci_private_submodules`, `layout.project_overrides`,
  `dependabot_cooldown_days`) gain local entries beside the public ones.
- **Validation**: the merged document passes the same typed models
  (`extra="forbid"`), so a typo in the local file fails loudly at load time
  instead of silently diverging.
- **Read timing**: the file is read once, when the config singleton is first
  fetched (module import of `flext_infra.config`). Restart any long-running
  process after editing it.
- **Never track it**: `.gitignore` blocks `/config/codegen-overrides.local.yaml`
  by SSOT rule; the guard gate rejects any diff reintroducing private values.

## List-typed registries

`providers` and `make.docs.github_repos` concatenate. A provider name must
resolve **exactly once** across the merged list, so never re-declare a name the
tracked files already carry — declare it in one layer only.

## Example

```yaml
Infra:
  codegen:
    providers:
      - name: my-org
        organization: my-org
        base_url: https://github.com/my-org
        branch: main
    dependabot_cooldown_days:
      my-repo: 7
  release:
    publishable_prefixes:
      - my-repo-
```

Every governed standalone repository keeps referencing its provider by name
from its own `config/workspace.yaml`; the registry entry above is what lets the
generator resolve it.
