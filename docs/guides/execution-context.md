## Runtime is the authority

Correct runtime behavior defines the contract; tests verify it. Replace mocks, fake
tools, private-function access, and assertions that only check how code was written
with observable inputs and effects through public interfaces, preserving functional
coverage. First reproduce the real public path and identify the executed artifact. Fix
obsolete tests or fixtures after that proof, never by changing the environment to keep
their expectations. A test result alone does not certify setup, generation, or
consumption at the integrated revision.

Before repeating a broad search, confirm branch, HEAD, local changes, PR, and declared
base. Check the runtime with `make status`: the execution path and installed version
must match the code under validation. An earlier log or an installation from a parent
workspace does not certify a standalone checkout. Work on the freshly fetched
integration tip of every repository involved.

## Environment activation

The `make setup` contract includes approving the `.envrc` with `direnv allow`.
Operational Make verbs activate that environment before handlers and hooks, except the
activation producer declared in `make.verbs`. For `gen`, the pin and the provisioned
physical environment are required before `pre-gen` and the selected handler. The default
handler runs one conform transaction, which includes generating the `.envrc`; a declared
`_custom-gen` still replaces that handler. Only then does Make activate the generated
environment and run `post-gen`. A producer or activation failure prevents the later hook
and keeps the command red, so `make gen` can repair a broken generated activation
without another writer outside the journal. Initial provisioning remains the
responsibility of `make setup`. Real commands work without wrapping each call in
`direnv exec`.

Activation loads the native `mise env --shell bash` output, which puts the
installed tool directories ahead of the host's shared shims. This includes the
self-managed Mise executable: a shim named `mise` otherwise invokes the host
release instead of the project release. Activation does not install tools or
write locks. The `.envrc` watches `.mise.toml` and `mise.lock` to reload after
`make upg`. A missing pin requires `make upg`; a runtime that is not yet installed
requires `make setup`, whose provisioning happens before activation.

If `mise.lock` has no self-managed Mise entry, `make setup` fails without
changing it. `make upg` uses the installed host Mise to resolve the declared
manifest first, then provisions the newly recorded release from its verified
asset and continues the normal lifecycle. The generated `.mise.toml` must match
the current toolchain owner before that recovery; `mise-config` conformance
repairs this single declaration without regenerating unrelated project files.

When Beads tracking is configured, the generated `.envrc.local` carries its environment:
`AGENTS_GAS_CITY_ROOT` selects the Gas City root, the Gas City runtime publication
provides the port, and the rig metadata provides its database in `server` mode. The
`.envrc` loads that file last. The environment source declared in
`BeadsWorkspaceEnvironmentSpec.environment_sources` provides the city identity; the
template fixes neither its location nor a port. JSON reads must succeed before any
variable is exported. If generation drops the server selection, fix the model or
template and regenerate; never initialize an embedded database or write host and port
by hand.

## Dependency locks

Configuration declares `latest`. `make upg` is the only verb that resolves newer
releases and writes the committed `uv.lock` and `mise.lock`. `make setup`, `make gen`,
and `make fmt` never upgrade: they install frozen from those locks, which is the CI
path. Git dependencies follow the tips of their declared integration branches, and `APPLY`
stays removed.

Each internal `flext-*` requirement declares its integration line in `pyproject.toml`,
never a commit: the resolved commit exists only in `uv.lock`, and only `make upg` moves
it to the line tip. The manifest does not pin revisions. A commit left in the
`pyproject.toml` projection is residue: `make gen` re-renders it on the detected line.
When the projection carries no line, a hand-written `project.flext_source` in the
manifest declares it, and a commit in a hand-written source fails. Fix the setup or
`upg` owner and regenerate through `make gen`; manual installs do not replace the cycle.

A workspace root declares each attached member, of any family, as an inline Git source
on the workspace's own integration line, the same line the governed `.gitmodules` requires
of that member. Only `flext-*` dependencies that are not members follow the FLEXT line.
The root `uv.lock` therefore resolves every member without a `[tool.uv.workspace]`
overlay.

## Runtime environment

Code in a checkout runs in the environment of its `RUNTIME_ROOT`. The generated Makefile
exports `RUNTIME_ROOT`, and flext-infra reads it as a typed declaration: the
`fresh-import` validation runs its probes with the platform-specific Python interpreter in the derived `RUNTIME_VENV`, never
with the interpreter hosting the tool. Without a declaration, the owner derives the
checkout's Git root; a declaration without an interpreter fails.

The environment belongs to the `RUNTIME_ROOT`. A member attached as a submodule uses
its containing Git superproject's environment. A standalone checkout or linked Git
worktree owns its physical `<RUNTIME_ROOT>/.venv`; it never resolves an environment
from the primary checkout or Git common directory. The generated Makefile, generated
`.envrc`, and `runtime_environment_dir` derive the same path. Neither a caller
variable nor a checkout-local symlink may redirect the environment.

## Mise launchers

`make upg` is also the only writer of `mise.version`, `bin/mise`, and `bin/mise.cmd`. It
resolves the Mise release once, through Mise itself (`mise latest` of
`toolchain.mise_selector`, narrowed to `toolchain.mise_version` when
`flext-infra/config/codegen.yaml` holds a release, authenticated by `GITHUB_TOKEN` and
subject to Mise's `minimum_release_age`), and generates both launchers with
`mise generate install-script --version <release> --windows`, run by that release. A
held release carries its reason beside it in the configuration and returns to `latest`
when the newest release outside the cooldown works. Each launcher embeds the release and its checksums, so
direct, PATH, or shim calls never query the network to choose a version.
`mise.version` holds a generated header followed by the single release line.

`make gen`, `make check`, and CI only verify offline that the launchers embed the pinned
release. A workspace member receives an exact copy of that trio from the root
`make gen`, and only the runtime root runs `make upg`. The `flext_infra` package ships
its own trio under `templates/bootstrap/`, used only by a repository that has none or
still carries a projection whose launchers resolve `releases/latest` at run time: that
repository's `make gen` publishes the packaged, baked copy, and the next `make upg`
rewrites it for the resolved release. Never edit these files; the fix is `make upg`.

A project `bin/` never enters PATH (shell, `BASH_ENV`, or CI `GITHUB_PATH`): Mise binds
the shared shims to the first `mise` on PATH. Version the pin, `mise.lock`, and the
native graphs referenced under `.mise/locks/` together; for npm tools the graph contains
`package.json` and `aube-lock.yaml`. These files also enter the Docker context and
checkout fixtures. Frozen setup requires the graph and a valid digest, per the
[official Mise sidecar contract](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html#native-dependency-sidecars).
Caches, installations, and local lock graphs stay out of Git. Never format or edit the
native payload: a byte change requires a new resolution through `make upg`.

During `make upg`, Mise resolves and installs in a sibling directory on the checkout's
filesystem. The generated `bin/mise-lock-transaction.py` verifies the staged native
graphs, publishes them before replacing `mise.lock`, and records a durable journal.
If publication stops after a graph moves, the next upgrade restores the committed
graph before starting its own publication. The lock rename is the commit point; a
failed upgrade leaves the previous lock usable without a live `.bak` copy.
When a broken upstream release fails the staged install, the generated
`bin/mise-lock-converge.py` holds each failing tool at its newest installable release
inside the stage only, under the same isolated environment the bootstrap declares; the
committed `.mise.toml` never changes, so the next upgrade retries the newest release.
When Git leaves the generated `mise.lock` unmerged, the publisher reads the exact
stage-2 lock from that repository's index solely to authenticate the existing
sidecars. It still derives the replacement lock from `.mise.toml` through `make upg`
and publishes that replacement transactionally. A malformed lock without a Git
conflict, or sidecars that no longer match stage 2, fails without changing the lock.

Mise reaches GitHub only to install a tool missing from the persistent cache and inside
`make upg`. Only `make upg` writes `mise.lock` and `uv.lock`; `make setup` never writes
either and always runs. Every Mise call except `install --yes` runs with the offline
settings declared once in `MISE_BOOTSTRAP_OFFLINE_ENVIRONMENT`. An offline
`install --dry-run` checks that the committed lock satisfies `.mise.toml`. When it does
not, setup prints a `WARN`, installs from `.mise.toml` with `MISE_LOCKFILE=false` and
`MISE_LOCKED=false` for the rest of that setup (the lifecycle inherits
`SETUP_MISE_LOCK_DRIFT`), and leaves `mise.lock` untouched. On the uv side, setup syncs
`--locked`; when `uv.lock` drifts from `pyproject.toml` it prints a `WARN` and syncs the
committed lock `--frozen`, which never writes it. The next `make upg` rewrites both
locks. `make upg` resolves once
per manifest: when the `.mise.toml` that its `gen` renders is byte-identical to the
manifest its first half locked, the relock half installs from the published lock instead
of resolving again. Wherever a lock runs, the bootstrap forwards the GitHub credential
it selected (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, else the declared `github_credential_commands`) to Mise.

The platforms declared by `toolchain.mise_lockfile_platforms` compose the lock together
with the platform of the machine running the upgrade, which Mise always includes.
Because `MISE_SAFE` ignores local settings, bootstrap forwards `MISE_LOCKFILE`,
`MISE_LOCKED`, and `MISE_LOCKFILE_PLATFORMS`, derived from the same typed owner.
`MISE_LOCKED` also enables the global guard against rewrites during installation;
`tool_config.locked` alone does not protect that boundary. The setup proof uses empty
Mise storage and verifies the bytes of the locks, the pin, and the whole native graph
after installation.

After resolving the Mise release, bootstrap keeps that version for every call of the
same operation and the recursive lifecycle. `upg` initializes the declared gitlinks
before resolving the Python locks. Other runtime-dependent verbs reject a missing or
unresolved pin before activation; `help` and `clean` remain local operations without
that dependency.

## SonarCloud exclusions

The committed-lock contract also removes the former SonarCloud exclusion for a missing
lock. `codegen.sonarcloud.issue_exclusions` remains the single source of the server
configuration. With `SONAR_TOKEN` in the environment, `make sonarcloud-sync` sends a
non-empty list through the `settings/set` API; an empty list uses
[`settings/reset`](https://sonarcloud.io/web_api/api/settings/reset) with `component`
and `keys`. The command rereads `settings/values` and requires the exact effective
value, including inherited exclusions. If the reset reveals an exclusion from a higher
level, the divergence remains a failure. A false positive on the native
`aube-lock.yaml` format requires individual adjudication with frozen-install proof; it
never authorizes broad exclusions or changes to the native payload.

## Bootstrap credentials

The GitHub credential is optional and is selected once, in the generated Makefile
preamble, for every verb: the first non-empty of the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`GH_TOKEN`, `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, then `gh auth token` when gh is installed and
authenticated. Make exports that one value as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, and
`MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, so gh, uv, and mise read the same credential and no inherited
alias can shadow it; `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` is unexported. The network bootstrap passes
the three names into its isolated `env -i` Mise environment. With no token, public
GitHub requests use the upstream tool's native unauthenticated behavior. The value
is never printed. An invalid token preserves the backend's native error, without an
anonymous retry or source switch. CI jobs inject `GITHUB_TOKEN`; containers receive
the variable or a BuildKit secret explicitly.

## Evidence and checkpoints

Each piece of evidence identifies command, directory, observed revision, exit code, and
decisive result. A run that is in progress, interrupted, or missing its exit code is not
green. Concurrent changes require a fresh read before writing and revalidation of the
affected paths. A published work-in-progress commit preserves work and enables review;
completion requires integration and runtime measured at the integrated SHA.

For namespace automation, investigate catalog, classifier, transformation, publication,
and consumers in that order. The namespace laws are codemod catalog rules, so the
codemod gate is their one verdict. Preserve mutability, inheritance, imports, and
collection; validate the transformation through the public interface before widening
the batch. Structural refactors go through `make mod`.

## Check gate partitions

No check gate is suspendable: every finding of every selected gate blocks. The
namespace laws are rule data of the codemod catalog and block through the codemod
gate. `make check` fails when the selection
contains no projects or when a selected project has no `pyproject.toml`; no project is
skipped silently.

Local runs, CI, and hooks derive their gates from the same active set: `CI=N make check`
and `make check` without `CI` run the complete active set. `CI=Y make check` excludes
only the declared `make.ci.local_check_gates` (Pyrefly remains in CI). The
configuration keeps Mypy, Pyright, codemod and smells out of CI. Every gate blocks in
every context that runs it; there is no informative or advisory gate. The `check`
pre-push hook drops the inherited `CI` to run every active gate, so Mypy and Pyright
block at pre-push. The pre-commit hook runs only the fast external gates the registry
declares (`make.check_gates_pre_commit`) and no tests.

Every workspace and standalone projection exposes `make pre-commit` for the fast hook
workflow. CI invokes the separate approval verbs declared by `make.workflow`, in their
declared order, and closes with `verify-clean`; it never substitutes the fast hook for
approval. The configured CI token selects the blocking CI gate partition. Audit is
read-only conformance and installed-lock provenance, not generation or a dirty-tree
check; legitimate staged changes are not rejected simply for being staged.

CI setup always reconciles the owned physical environment through locked,
noneditable installation, including an existing venv. It does not initialize,
activate or operate on members, and uses root-declared topology rather than reading
sibling manifests. Local setup without the CI token retains local source routing.
Only local upgrade resolves or writes locks; setup preserves the first install error
without retrying under a different lock mode.

Normal test verbs remain incremental testmon only and omit the configured slow
markers. The filesystem cache lives at the typed XDG/HOME-derived project path.
Actions restores only that project database and saves only on an allowed integration
push with a fresh completed-run path/digest/saveability receipt. The SQLite owner
checkpoints and checks integrity before the runner releases its lease and exports
the receipt. PRs, forks, cancelled or incomplete runs cannot publish cache state;
a completed failing test run may save without changing its failing status.

`smells` is not part of the `make check` partitions. The selector-free `make smells`
verb runs only the qlty smell scan and fails when it finds defects. The
`runtime-census` gate stays in `make check` and grades every runtime enforcement
finding, including rules that qlty also classifies as smells. An empty or
malformed qlty SARIF response is a failed scan, not a zero-finding receipt.

## Bounded Mypy failure status

The Linux Mypy command applies `prlimit` before launching the checker. In the observed
Mypy 2.3.1 run, an exhausted plugin allocation produced `INTERNAL ERROR` and exit status
2;
[the tagged Mypy source](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/v2.3.1/mypy/main.py#L167-L174)
assigns status 2 to blocking internal errors. This is version-specific behavior, not a
fixed expectation for later Mypy releases. The resource test requires the workload to
start, then a nonzero raw status and a diagnostic without a timeout; it never rewrites
the result into a synthetic `MemoryError` or success. The Darwin supervisor can instead
terminate a process whose resident memory exceeds its limit.

## Abstraction-boundary project identity

The boundary gate reads the declared project identity through
`u.Infra.read_project_metadata_result`. Owner exemptions and TOML allowances use that
typed identity, so renaming a checkout or creating a linked worktree does not change its
policy. A consumer placed in an owner's named directory remains a consumer. Missing or
malformed project metadata blocks the gate and preserves the metadata reader's
diagnostic; directory names are never identity fallbacks.

## Codemod scanner contract

Every codemod policy finding blocks the gate, whatever its rule severity. Failed rule
discovery, failed scanner execution, incomplete output, and invalid diagnostic payloads
block as native failures with their own diagnostics.

The gate consumes the complete native `ast-grep scan --json=compact` array. The
[documented scan contract](https://ast-grep.github.io/reference/cli/scan.html) and
[native diagnostic schema](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/tools/json) distinguish a
completed scan with error-severity findings (exit 1) from a completed scan without
error-severity findings (exit 0). Exit 1 must carry only ast-grep's complete terminal
diagnostic, whose count equals the validated error-severity findings. Additional
traversal diagnostics remain blocking: ast-grep can continue after an unreadable path
and still return exit 1 because another file contains a finding. The scanner boundary
checks the
[native terminal diagnostic](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/blob/0.45.3/crates/cli/src/utils/error_context.rs#L200)
and rejects extra output from the
[native path worker](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/blob/0.45.3/crates/cli/src/utils/worker.rs#L92).
Timeouts, forwarded signals, other exit codes, malformed JSON, and disagreement between
exit code and diagnostic severities remain failures, even when stdout exists. Both
whole-project checks and `check_files` scan every elected provider rule.

`GateExecution.issues` retains each finding's original file, position, rule, message,
and severity. SARIF reports each finding at its native level; raw scanner output remains
available on the execution. A passing gate therefore proves both the scanner contract
and zero rule findings.

The same repair validates projected Ruff first-party namespaces strictly: a malformed
value cannot be replaced with discovered namespaces. A declared empty list remains
empty; namespace discovery applies only when the list is absent. A bare Python
annotation does not replace an existing facade binding. Mypy's module-specific
`follow_untyped_imports` policy analyzes Rope's installed source without suppressing
`import-untyped`; the typed tooling policy owns both template and dependency-modernizer
projections. See the
[Mypy option contract](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#follow-untyped-imports).
