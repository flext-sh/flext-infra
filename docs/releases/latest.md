## Current state

Release notes are maintained history; this section records the live state of the `0.12.0-dev`
line without rewriting shipped history.

- **Integration tip:** `flext-infra@a2bd0a7262a0eab84bd7e4c27f8bdd10de0d247a`, superproject
  `676ae7aa3c7511ce3b133fdd31e43cfc49e7564f`.
- **Not green:** `make setup`, `make gen`, `make check`, `make test`, `make build` have no current
  passing evidence on this tip. The canonical cycle (phases 3 and 8 of the runtime-modernization
  plan) is not started.
- **Open defects:** `_lazy_analysis` scope mismatch in
  `src/flext_infra/codegen/_conform/execute.py:376/598`; god modules `_models/config.py` (3.342 LOC)
  and `codegen/conform.py` (2.996 LOC) unchanged.
- **Adopted constraints:** `APPLY`, `uv.lock`, `mise.lock` and `exclude-newer` are banned
  project-wide; Beads are Gas City only; `make setup` is the sole provisioning path.
- **Recovery:** Gas City tasks `flext-itpd1.2` and `flext-5fxu6.4`, plus
  `docs/roadmap/namespace-automation-handoff-2026-09-14.md`.
