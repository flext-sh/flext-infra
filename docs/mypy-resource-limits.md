# Mypy resource limits

The same validated memory (MiB) and wall-time (seconds) settings apply on Linux
and macOS. The platform owns the mechanism:

- Linux keeps GNU `timeout` and `prlimit --as` unchanged: the kernel limits each
  process's virtual address space.
- macOS uses the bundled Python supervisor and native `/bin/ps`. It samples the
  combined resident memory (RSS) of the checker process group every 100 ms and
  terminates the group when the configured threshold or deadline is reached.
  This is a sampled termination threshold, not a kernel allocation barrier;
  transient memory overshoot and sampling latency are possible. Virtual mappings
  are not charged as resident memory. Descendants must remain in the group.

Darwin `RLIMIT_AS` is not interchangeable with Linux `prlimit`: the initial VM
mappings of an ordinary Python process can already exceed the Mypy budget, and
Darwin rejects lowering the limit below current usage. See Apple's
[resource-limit implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/bsd/kern/kern_resource.c)
and Python's [resource documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html).

The supervisor inherits the checker's input and output, preserves normal exit
codes, reports deadline exhaustion as 124 and memory exhaustion as 137, and
forwards TERM, INT and HUP. Cleanup sends TERM (or the received signal), then KILL
after the configured grace period, including descendants left after the checker
exits. Accounting failures terminate the workload and propagate the error; they
never cause an unbounded execution. No GNU utility, extra package, or shell shim
is required on macOS.
