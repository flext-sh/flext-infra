- Unreleased

- **Exterminated the `APPLY` write-enable flag (operator law 2026-09-11).**
  Every public Make verb mutates by default with zero variables; read-only
  verification lives in dedicated verbs (`check`) and explicit modes
  (`codegen conform --mode check`). Docs, templates, config schema
  (`apply_variable`/`apply_value`/`apply_absent_value`, per-verb
  `requires_apply`, workflow `apply` intents) and the docs command
  contract validator were removed or inverted accordingly.

- E2E make-work disposable proof (bead flext-4gh1).
