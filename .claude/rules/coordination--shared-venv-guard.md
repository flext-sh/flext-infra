# Python environments are physical and checkout-local

Use the repository's declared setup owner and interpreter. Each authorized
checkout reconstructs its own physical environment.

- Never borrow another checkout's environment through a symlink, path
  dependency, `PYTHONPATH`, editable-install path, or cross-repository
  reference.
- Never replace or clear a real environment while another process may own it.
- While orchestration is suspended, use only the environment already owned by
  the existing authorized checkout; create no clone, worktree, or alternate
  workspace.
- Missing or stale environment state is red. Repair it through the repository's
  canonical setup surface only when that mutation is authorized.
