"""Topological publish ordering behavior for the release orchestrator.

Publishing to an index is immutable, so a dependent uploaded before its
dependency leaves the index in a state no rollback can repair. The order is
derived from each project's declared dependencies -- never from a hand-written
list that silently diverges from the manifests it claims to describe.
