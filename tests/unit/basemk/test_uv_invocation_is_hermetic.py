"""Every generated ``uv`` invocation resolves the project's own runtime.

``uv`` honours ``VIRTUAL_ENV``, ``UV_PROJECT`` and ``UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT``
from the ambient environment. A developer or CI job with another project's
virtualenv active therefore hijacks the runtime: the generated Makefile asks
for ``--project <this repo>`` but ``uv`` resolves interpreter and packages from
the *caller's* environment instead.

The template already knows this. ``FLEXT_INFRA_BOOTSTRAP`` and
``PROJECT_FLEXT_INFRA`` both strip all three variables before calling ``uv``.
``UV_RUN`` -- the definition that actually runs pytest, ruff, pyright and mypy
-- stripped only ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``MYPYPATH``, so the gates were the one
surface left exposed.

That gap produced false evidence, not just a slow path: with another project's
venv exported, ``make test`` imported ``flext_infra`` from that venv's
site-packages and validated this repository's tree against a stale installed
copy. Gate results then describe code that is not under test.

This pins the invariant at the template: no ``uv`` invocation may be built
without the full environment sanitation prefix.
