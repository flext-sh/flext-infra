"""Deactivation contract for the ENFORCE-039 cast-remover fix target.

The cast remover rewrote sources through the raw ``ast`` module and removed
casts that were load-bearing (an untyped third-party module lookup, a
``Literal`` narrowing), raising the type-error count. Raw ``ast`` rewriting is
not an approved surface — only ast-grep codemod rules (``make mod``) and rope
are — and neither approved surface can decide whether a cast is redundant,
because that is a type-inference question. The fix target is therefore
deactivated: the violation is still reported, the automatic rewrite is off.
