r"""Deactivation contract for the ENFORCE-031/ENFORCE-032 Dict fix targets.

Both transformers rewrote sources with a raw regex over the whole file
(``\bDict\s*\[`` and ``\btyping\s*\.\s*Dict\s*\[``). A regex cannot tell
a type node from text, so one run rewrote docstrings that documented the
pattern, comments naming it, and the string literals of this package's own
rewrite tables — corrupting ten files. Regex rewriting is not an approved
surface; only ast-grep codemod rules (``make mod``) and rope are. The rewrite is
recomposed as the ast-grep rule ``typing-dict-to-mapping-kv`` (with the
detection-only companion ``typing-dict-missing-t-import``), which matches
tree-sitter nodes and therefore cannot reach a string, docstring or comment.
The transformer fix targets are deactivated: the violation is still reported,
the automatic rewrite is off.
