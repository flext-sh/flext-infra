"""``FLEXT=<worktree>`` rebinds an external consumer onto one flext checkout.

An external project declares flext packages by pinned git URL, so it validates
PUBLISHED code and never the checkout being worked on. Reviewing a cross-project
change then required publishing first, which is backwards.

The binding is a SESSION override, not a declaration: the consumer's
``pyproject.toml`` keeps its pins untouched, so nothing local is ever committed
and dropping the flag restores the pinned resolution. Which distributions get
rebound is derived from the worktree's own manifest, never a hardcoded list.
