"""CI rewrites private submodule origins to SSH; resolution must still find the provider.

The generated workflow materializes a read-only deploy key per private member and
points that member's ``origin`` at an SSH URL, sometimes through a Host alias so
two keys can coexist on one forge. Provider resolution reads the live ``origin``,
so it has to accept every remote form Git accepts, not only HTTPS.
