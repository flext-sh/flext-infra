"""Behavior contract for deferred-self-reference and recursive-model detection.

Both defects share one root cause: a nested model that cannot name what it
depends on while its own class body executes. The canonical repair is
diamond-FLEXT composition, so the detector must fire on the deferral and stay
silent once the model is composed through inherited namespaces.
