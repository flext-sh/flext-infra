"""Generated search paths never leave the project that owns them.

A search-path entry is written into a project's own ``pyproject.toml``, so it
describes that project forever. ``../<sibling>/src`` describes the *host* the
generator happened to run on: it is wrong in any clone whose siblings sit
elsewhere, it is absent in a worktree that materializes one project alone, and
it makes the same generator emit different content per checkout. Cross-checkout
dependencies resolve through their installed distributions instead (flext-c6di).
