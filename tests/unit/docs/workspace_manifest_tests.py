"""The fleet-umbrella question has exactly one owner and one signal.

Why this exists: the workspace-manifest path was re-derived in five places, and
a sixth copy asked the wrong file. It tested the Beads override, which every
project carries, so every standalone project was classified as a fleet umbrella.
That misrouting collapsed each project's docs scope onto an identical root scope
and silently dropped its README and project docs.

These cases pin the signal itself, independently of the docs generator, so the
classification cannot drift again. Both artifacts are written through the shared
fixture owners, so a test never encodes a second spelling of either file.
