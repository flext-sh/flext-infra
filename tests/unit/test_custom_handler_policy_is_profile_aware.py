"""Tests that the custom-handler policy is declared per Make profile.

``custom_handler_policy`` was a single flat rule applied to every profile, but
the profiles have genuinely different contracts:

* a standalone repository may only define private
  ``_custom_<verb>_<what>`` handlers and hooks;
* a workspace *root* orchestrates the members, so its ``custom.mk`` legitimately
  owns public orchestration targets and the variables they read.

Applying the member rule to the root made ``codegen conform`` reject the root's
own surface on every run and block the whole transaction -- which is why no
other generated artifact could be landed.

The policy is therefore keyed by profile, and the engine selects the entry for
the profile it is conforming instead of assuming one shape fits every project.
