"""Tests that the codegen engine carries no downstream-consumer knowledge.

``flext-infra`` is a generalized engine. Its configuration SSOT declares only
the provider and repositories it owns; every downstream consumer declares its
own topology in its own ``config/workspace.yaml``. Embedding a consumer's
repositories here couples the engine to projects it must not know about.

The owning identity is never hardcoded: it is derived from the engine's own
distribution name (``pyproject.toml`` metadata SSOT) resolved against the
repository catalog the engine publishes.
