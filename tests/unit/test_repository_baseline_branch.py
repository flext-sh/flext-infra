"""Baseline branch derives from live repository reality, not a provider constant.

A provider declares ONE branch, but managed repositories under the same provider
legitimately integrate on different branches (for example ``dev`` and
``develop``). Deriving the baseline from ``provider.branch`` therefore fails
closed on every repository whose integration branch differs from the provider
default. The canonical baseline is the integration branch the repository really
publishes, discovered from Git itself.
