"""A project extends its generated CI through its own custom-steps file.

The generator injects the declared block verbatim and never interprets it, so a
project adds a step its pipeline needs — a credential, a service, a probe —
without the generator carrying that project's concerns. This is the CI
counterpart of ``custom.mk``.
