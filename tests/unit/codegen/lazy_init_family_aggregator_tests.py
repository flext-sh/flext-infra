"""A re-export aggregator's ``__all__`` never claims single ownership.

Regression coverage: a generated TYPE_CHECKING re-export sidecar (e.g.
``tests/_exports_typing_facades.py`` in flext-core) imports many facades and
relists their class/alias names in its own ``__all__``. ``_resolve_family``
used to derive that module's ``expected_alias``/``expected_family`` from the
FIRST class/alias pair appearing in its ``__all__`` -- exactly as if the
aggregator itself declared that class. When a two-base root ``constants.py``
module (``class X(ExternalConstants, OwnProjectConstants)``) happened to be
the alphabetically-first re-export in the aggregator's list, the aggregator
tied the real owner's collision score and won the tie-break, dropping the
real ``constants.py``-owned class and alias entirely from the generated root
``__init__.py``.
