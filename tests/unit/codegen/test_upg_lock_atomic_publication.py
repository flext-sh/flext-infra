"""``make upg`` publishes uv.lock atomically: an interrupted run leaves it intact.

uv truncates and rewrites ``uv.lock`` in place, so a run killed while uv
wrote it left a partial lock behind (flext-idihq). The upgrade lifecycle
resolves in a scratch mirror and publishes by one rename, so the committed lock
survives any interruption byte-for-byte and a reader never observes a partial
file.
