"""A workspace root keeps every attached member in its native uv workspace.

The root environment serves every attached member: setup syncs the root lock
with ``--all-packages``, so a conform that drops a member from
``[tool.uv.workspace]`` (or from its ``workspace = true`` source) makes that
sync uninstall the member and every later member import fails. The retired
git-pinned ``workspace`` dependency group never returns: a member declared
both as a path and as a URL is a uv conflict.
