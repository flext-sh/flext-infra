"""FlextConstantsStatus - domain lifecycle and status enumerations (SSOT).

Merges Status (domain), CommonStatus/OperationStatus/SpecialStatus (cqrs),
CheckStatus (mixins), and HealthStatus into a single flat enum family
exposed via `c.Status`. Health-specific values stay on a separate
`c.HealthStatus` because they carry a distinct semantic meaning (health
check state vs. lifecycle state).
