"""Entity and DDD patterns for FLEXT ecosystem.

TIER 1: Uses base.py (Tier 0) + constants, typings, protocols, runtime only.
Imports m and adds only DDD-specific data classes.

The DomainEvent is defined in domain_event.py and imported here to
avoid Pydantic forward-reference issues with nested class annotations.
