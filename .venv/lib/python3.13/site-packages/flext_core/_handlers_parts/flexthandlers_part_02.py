"""CQRS handler foundation used by the dispatcher pipeline.

h defines the base class the dispatcher relies on for commands,
queries, and domain events. It favors structural typing over inheritance,
ensures validation and execution steps return ``r`` rather than
raising, and keeps handler metadata ready for registry/dispatcher discovery.
